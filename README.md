The GasperMIDI-config is a PWA website intended to be a mobile/desktop application for configuring custom DIY MIDI controller GasperMIDI.

Download it on chromium-based browsers on [Github Pages](https://smartcatloaf.github.io/GasperMIDI-config/)

The app includes next features:
 - theme switching
 - resolution drop-down
 - CC number inputs
 - button to send configuration to arduino
 - connection with WebSerialApi
 - uploading support for computers

Sadly i couldn't get it to fully work with mobile devices / tablets but it works with desktop.
